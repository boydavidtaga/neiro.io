Currying and partial function application are common concepts of the functional
programming. They look similar, but have differences in realization and using.
Ruby allows you to easily operate with both of them.

## Partial function application

First we need to know what is really *application* is: it's the process of applying
function to **all of it's arguments** to return value.  
*Partial function application* is the process of applying function to **some of it's arguments**.
This process creates a new function, based on the parent function,
  but with lower arity (*with fewer arguments*).
So, if we have an abstract function ![f1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/a/43a45f58c8f35707c396444463e2ef24.png)
with three arguments, then we can create a partial function ![f2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/d/5/1d54867424707e76c6f46bf426fc193e.png)
with two arguments that both of this functions return the same result.

For example, we have a simple multiply function that multiplies two arguments:  

{% highlight ruby %}
  multiply = -> (x, y) { x * y }
  multiply.(2, 2) # 4
{% endhighlight %}

But what if we want just double numbers ? Should we pass the *2* argument
each time? Not really. We can use partial function application to create a new
*double* function that takes just one argument:  

{% highlight ruby %}
  double = -> (x) { multiply.(2, x) }
  double.arity # 1
  double.(2) # 4
  double.(1984) # 3968
{% endhighlight %}

Ruby has *Proc#curry* method that allows you to use partial function application
even more simpler:

{% highlight ruby %}
  double = multiply.curry.(2)
  double.(2) # 4
  double.(300) # 600
{% endhighlight %}


## Currying

Currying is similar to partial function application concept.  

**Currying** is the process
of translating the evaluating of *function with many arguments* into evaluating 
a sequence of functions, each with *exactly one parameter*. So, if we have a function
with two arguments: ![f1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/b/43ba302d099d623ae50cce466eb1f34d.png)
then we can translate it with ![l](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/3/0138ee5c8706ca68729e27f0e01e56ee.png) transformation
to return a new function with one parameter: ![f2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/5/7b547dc91687bfb09ee27d4c22f815eb.png).

For example, look back at previous *multiply* function.
What if we want to multiply more than two arguments?  

{% highlight ruby %}
  multiply.(2, 2, 2) # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 3, expected 2)
{% endhighlight %}

To prevent this, we can change multiply function and use *Proc#curry* method:

{% highlight ruby %}
  multiply = -> (head, *tail) { head || 1 * tail.inject(1, &:*) }
  multiply.curry.(2, 2, 2) # 8
  multiply.curry.(2, 3, 7) # 42
{% endhighlight %}

If we want to restrict arguments count, we can use *arity* optional argument in 
*Proc#curry* function:

{% highlight ruby %}
  multiply.curry(3)[1][2][3] # 6
  multiply.curry(3)[1][2][3][4] # 0 because of the last argument is nil
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use *curry* method on plain methods, not only procs with Ruby 2.2:

{% highlight ruby %}
  def sum(*args)
    args.inject(:+)
  end

  plus_two = method(:sum).curry(2).(2)
  plus_two.(3) # 5
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion

Partial function application and currying are both great features of functional
programming that allows you to write clean, simple and flexible functions based on anothers.
You can use Ruby's *#curry* method with procs or methods to write eloquent and 
powerful code.
